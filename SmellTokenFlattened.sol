 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because the signature is
 * a message signed by an account, and messages can be signed without the intent to send a transaction on Ethereum, a
 * signature can be obtained without the knowledge of the private key (e.g. by social engineering) and used by an
 * attacker.
