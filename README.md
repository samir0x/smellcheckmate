# Smell Checkmate

Welcome to **Smell Checkmate**, the first mobile app that allows users to anonymously rate others' hygiene, smell, and attitude, aiming to foster personal improvement in a non-confrontational way.

## Project Overview

**Smell Checkmate** operates on the Optimism blockchain and base blockchain, leveraging its scalability and low transaction costs to ensure privacy and data integrity. This project combines social interaction with blockchain technology to provide a unique platform for anonymous feedback.

### Features
- **Anonymous Ratings**: Users can give feedback on others' hygiene, smell, and attitude without revealing their identity.
- **Blockchain Security**: All ratings are stored on the blockchain to ensure they cannot be altered or deleted by anyone except the owner of the data.
- **User Incentives**: Future plans include rewards for active participation or positive feedback.
